## Git Terminologies

### Repository (Repo)

### Commit
commit is a change that you bring to your program, it can be adding, removing, modifying code or files from your project.

### Branch:
Versions of a repository that differ from the main working project. These are helpful when you are working with a team or don't want to lose your main project.

### Clone:
Copy of a repository in your workstation.

### Fetch:
By performing a Git fetch, you are downloading and copying that branchâ€™s files to your workstation.

### Fork:
Creates a copy of a repository in your account.

### Master
The primary branch of all repositories. All committed and accepted changes should be on the master branch. You can work directly from the master branch, or create other branches.

### Merge
Taking the changes from one branch and adding them into another branch.

### Pull Request
Pull requests ask the repo maintainers to review the commits made, and then, if acceptable, merge the changes.
